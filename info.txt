Some notes for Django:

To initiate Python projects:
    -$ django-admin startproject mysite


Running development server:
    - cd into mysite
    - run command: python manage.py runserver

To Create an app:
    - python manage.py startapp polls


Creating views:
    - go into app-directory/views and enter code:
        from django.http import HttpResponse
        def index(request):
            return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")


    - in app folder create urls.py file:
        from django.urls import path
        from . import views
        urlpatterns = [
            path('', views.index, name='index'),
        ]


# Database bindings are interpreters for data tables
Recommended Database Bindings:
    - Postgre SQL

# if you are not using SQLite as your database, additional settings such as USER, PASSWORD, and HOST must be added. 
# For more details, see the reference documentation for DATABASES.


push migrations for apps:
    - python manage.py makemigrations appName
    # e.g. python manage.py makemigrations polls


MAKE CHANGES TO DATABASES
- Change your models (in models.py).
- Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
- Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.
